# StemSongs
StemSongs is my attempt at highly-accurate music recommendation. The user inputs a song, that song is stemmed into its main components (bass, drums, vocal, and other), and each stem is individually compared with stems of the same type from a database I've compiled. This (ideally) results in finding songs that are genuinely similar to eachother, based on an algortithm of comparison between stems. For the sake of this project, the database only consists of royalty-free songs that I could download for free. Try it out!
